Supported SSH Ciphers on BIG-IP VE

According to the F5 Security Target documentation for BIG-IP version 16.1.3.1 (SSLO ST, Dec 2023), the default SSH configuration includes the following:

Transport encryption algorithms:

AES-CBC-128

AES-CBC-256

AES-CTR-128

AES-CTR-256

Public-key authentication algorithms:

ecdsa-sha2-nistp256

ecdsa-sha2-nistp384

Integrity (MAC) algorithms:

hmac-sha1

hmac-sha2-256

Key exchange (KEX) methods:

ecdh-sha2-nistp256

ecdh-sha2-nistp384 
fmv.se

While this information comes from the security evaluation for version 16.1.3.1, it's a safe assumption that these defaults hold for subsequent versions in the 17.x series, unless explicitly changed by F5 in release notes.

Default Configuration Snapshot
Category	Default Algorithms on BIG-IP VE
Transport Encryption	AES-CBC-128, AES-CBC-256, AES-CTR-128, AES-CTR-256
Public-Key Auth	ECDSA with curves NIST P-256 and P-384
Integrity (MAC)	HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA2-256
Key Exchange (KEX)	ECDH using NIST P-256 and P-384
Can These Be Changed?

Yes, the list of supported ciphers, MACs, and KEX algorithms can be modified. F5 provides guidance under article K80425458, which covers how to modify the SSH configuration (sshd_config) to allow or restrict specific algorithms

Additionally, community discussions (e.g., DevCentral) indicate that by default, only aes128-cbc and aes256-cbc may be enabled, suggesting configurations may vary by version or by administrative customization

What You Can Do Next

Check your appliance version — confirm which TMOS version your VE is running (e.g., via tmsh show /sys version).

List current SSH configuration:

tmsh list /sys sshd


or inspect /config/ssh/sshd_config directly.

Compare against defaults — see if the AES-CTR, HMAC-SHA2, or ECDH KEX algorithms are present or have been customized.

Adjust as needed using F5’s SSH customization guidance (K80425458).

Let me know if you’d like help walking through the CLI commands or interpreting the output for your specific setup!

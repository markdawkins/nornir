#############Install guide for Favorite Programs on a linux box############

1. Update Your System (Always do this first)
Before installing any new software, it's good practice to update your package list.

bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
2. Install All Software at Once
You can install all of your requested programs in a single command.

bash
sudo apt install wireshark filezilla qbittorrent chrome-browser code
You will be prompted for your password. Note that typing the password is invisible (no asterisks * appear). Just type it and press Enter.

3. Or, Install Them Individually:
If you prefer to install them one by one, or need specific instructions for each, use the commands below.

Individual Application Notes & Post-Install Steps
1. Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)
Installation:

bash
sudo apt install wireshark
Crucial Post-Installation Setup:
During installation, a graphical configuration window may appear asking if non-superusers should be allowed to capture packets. Select "Yes".

If you missed this window or it didn't appear, you must add your user to the wireshark group to use it without running as root (which is a security risk):

bash
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
You must completely log out of Ubuntu and log back in (or restart your computer) for this group change to take effect.

2. FileZilla (FTP/SFTP Client)
Installation:

bash
sudo apt install filezilla
No special setup is required. You can find it in your applications menu and start transferring files immediately.

3. Google Chrome (Web Browser)
The chrome-browser package in the Ubuntu repos will install the official Google Chrome. The installation process will automatically:

Download the latest Google Chrome .deb package.

Add the official Google repository to your system's software sources (/etc/apt/sources.list.d).

Install Chrome and set it up for automatic updates via apt.

Installation:

bash
sudo apt install chrome-browser
4. qBittorrent (BitTorrent Client)
Installation:

bash
sudo apt install qbittorrent
This installs the free, open-source, and full-featured version. No setup is required. Launch it from your application menu.

Add Microsoft's official GPG key and repository to your system.

Install the latest version of VS Code.

Set it up for automatic updates.
